    <pre>
        I ask them to take a poem
        and hold it up to the light
        like a color slide
                          
        or press an ear against its hive.
                        
        I say drop a mouse into a poem
        and watch him probe his way out,
        or walk inside the poem's room
        and feel the walls for a light switch.
                          
        I want them to waterski
        across the surface of a poem
        waving at the author's name on the shore.
                         
        But all they want to do
        is tie the poem to a chair with rope
        and torture a confession out of it.
                         
        They begin beating it with a hose
        to find out what it really means.
